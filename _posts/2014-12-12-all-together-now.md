A journey through the cultural past of Walthamstow with Philippa Buxton. We will re-disocover the wonders of Walthamstow's musical heritage through song, stories, make believe and craft.

All Together Now is a new musical Heritage Project that brings together members of the Walthamstow community through Songs and Stories harking back to the rich musical past of Walthamstow and the East End.

There are limited places, so book early by emailing [pippajwright@gmail.com](mailto:pippajwright@gmail.com)
