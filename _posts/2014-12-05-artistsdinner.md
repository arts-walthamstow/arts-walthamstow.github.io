Artists' dinner for artists and non-artists to share stories of your art. Bring a dish and an example of your work.

This can be an object, slide, text, image, video or performance. Around 10 minutes each so there'll be time to eat and chat with each other.

There are limited places, so book early by emailing [layla@shunt.co.uk][email-link]
