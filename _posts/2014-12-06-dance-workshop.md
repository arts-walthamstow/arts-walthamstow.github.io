**14:00 - 15:00 CLASSICAL INDIAN MUSIC WORKSHOP with Charlie**

Have fun learning Indian ‘Golden Oldies’ and Ghazals (Urdu love songs) with Khyal Arts’ resident vocal teacher through means of Hindustani Vocals and Harmonium.

This will have an informal, friendly, and all-inclusive sing-along feel - the primary aim of the workshop to provide relaxation and enjoyment, and for the participants to feel at their ease.

**15:05-15:15 DANCE PERFORMANCE: PRASHANTI**

*Choreographed and performed by Vanessa Downie*

Prashanti, being a girl's name, meaning peace and tranquillity. The eponymous character in this piece is confused and tormented by the fact that her life consists merely of chaos and turmoil, despite the meaning of her name. She desperately longs for the peace that she believes should be tightly bound together with her identity and therefore rightfully bestowed upon her.

She desperately longs for the peace that she believes, based on the meaning of her name, should be bound with her identity and therefore rightfully bestowed upon her.

Prashanti, also the title of the accompanying music (a duet by Ravi Shankar and Philip Glass) incorporates movement from western contemporary dance, with influence from Indian classical dance forms.
