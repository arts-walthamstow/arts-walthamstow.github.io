A workshop of colour naming games and sensory exploration of colour mixing. Facilitated by Dimitris Mylonas.

A drop in, family friendly workshop on the art and science of colour. This workshop aims to present the (mis-)communication involved in the use of natural language to describe colours.

Participants will have the opportunity to play a physical colour communication card game. Drawing on that experience your cognitive aspects of colour will be compared with thousands participants of a multilingual colour naming experiment conducted over the Internet.

The online colour naming experiment has been running since 2008 and has been translated so far in fourteen languages available at [colornaming.net](http://colornaming.net).

At the conclusion of this game, you will know that successful colour communication requires user-centered design thinking and you will have an insight about the order that colours are identified. This session should be of interest of those associated with colour in art and design, cognitive science, computer vision and linguistics. Participation in the colour naming card game will proceed on a first-come, first-served basis.
