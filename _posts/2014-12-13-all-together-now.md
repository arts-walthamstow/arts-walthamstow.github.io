Drop in for a cup of tea, a chat and a good old knees-up. Philippa Buxton will be bringing together as many locals as possible to remember the good old days, singing songs that have shaped our town's rich history and sharing stories and memories.

All Together Now is a new musical Heritage Project that brings together members of the Walthamstow community through Songs and Stories harking back to the rich musical past of Walthamstow and the East End.

Musicians, families, friends, all are welcome. 2pm: tea and chats, 3pm: Knees Up, 4.30pm more tea and stories.
