Song and Story telling with Philippa Buxton - vintage session.

All Together Now is a new musical Heritage Project that brings together members of the Walthamstow community through Songs and Stories harking back to the rich musical past of Walthamstow and the East End.

Members of the community are welcomed to come together for a good old knees up and natter, sharing memories and music.
