This is for anyone looking for the chance to give their voice a good outing! Facilitated by [Richard Hollingworth][link].

This session is modelled on actor’s pre-performance warm-ups. For newcomers, this combines a little background knowledge on healthy voice usage, how to articulate clearly in English and creative use of voice. It’s a whirlwind, 60 minute group workshop, that covers warm ups, games and exercises to get your voice and speech firing on all cylinders, whatever your experience.

There are limited places, so book early by emailing [info@veryvocab.co.uk][email-link]
