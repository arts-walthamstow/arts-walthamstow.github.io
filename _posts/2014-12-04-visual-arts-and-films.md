**What if...?** is a performance installation created and directed by Shunt Artist [Layla Rosa](http://www.laylarosa.co.uk). It looks through the eyes of another; inside, outside, behind and beyond the veil and is driven by the curiosities around a lost cultural identity.

Layla will be presenting video installation created for the performance in collaboration with Video Designer Susanne Dietz with sound by Max Ringham.
