  Introducing WPAC
</h2>
<p>

Introducing Walthamstow Performing Arts Collective (WPAC) sees us taking over a shop unit on 38 Hoe Street and presenting a public programme from <strong>Thursday, 4th December 2014 until Sunday, 14th</strong>.
</p><p>
With this we bring visual art, theatre, dance, music, science, film and food. WPAC sees a community coming together to share across the spectrum and see what the future holds. <strong>Can wE17 have a community-led performance space?</strong>
</p>
